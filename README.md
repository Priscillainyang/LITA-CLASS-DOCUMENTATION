# LITA-Capstone-project
## LITA offered me an admission on Data Analysis. We started with Excel, Power-BI and SQL. My applied practicals are documented here.
## PROJECT TITLE: LITA Capstone projects based on Sales and Customer Dataset.
Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Querying using Excel, SQL and Power BI.

### **Project Overview**
The primary goal of this project is to clean and structure a raw data set using Excel for initial organization, perform data summarization and insights using pivot tables, and conduct basic querying for analysis using SQL and Power BI for summary. The cleaned dataset, summarized in Excel using some Excel functions including conditional functions; and pivot tables and further analyzed with SQL queries and Power BI, provides insights into trends, patterns, and outliers. The project delivers actionable recommendations based on the analysis to assist in data-driven decision-making.

### **Data Source**
Our tutors gave the dataset to us, in persons of Mr Mushin and Mr Femi.

**Tools Used**
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
